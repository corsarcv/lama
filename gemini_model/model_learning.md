# Model Learning Factors
1. **Market Complexity and Volatility:** Stock markets are complex adaptive systems influenced by news, economics, psychology, and countless other factors. Highly volatile periods or assets may require more data to capture diverse behaviors, while stable periods might seem easier but could lack examples of sudden shifts.clear
2. **Prediction Time Horizon:** Predicting the next few hours (like your goal) likely requires higher frequency data (e.g., minute or hourly) and might be more sensitive to recent patterns. Predicting months ahead would need longer-term (daily/weekly) data capturing broader cycles.
3. **Data Granularity:** If you use daily data, "1 year" means ~252 data points. If you use hourly data, "1 year" means ~1600+ data points (assuming ~6.5 trading hours/day). The number of records often matters more than the absolute time span for training neural networks.
4. **Model Complexity:** More complex models (like deeper LSTMs or models with many features) generally require more data to learn effectively and avoid overfitting (memorizing the training data instead of learning general patterns). Our 6-feature LSTM is moderately complex.
5. **Feature Quality and Lag:** The chosen features (Price, Vol, MA, EMA, MACD, RSI) have inherent lags (e.g., MACD depends on 26 past periods). The model needs enough data before the period of interest for these indicators to be meaningful. This is reflected in MIN_RECORDS_FOR_INDICATORS.
6. **Stock-Specific Behavior:** Some stocks are more "predictable" or follow technical patterns more closely than others.
7. **Definition of "Success":** Are you aiming to predict direction correctly >50% of the time? Achieve a certain profit factor in backtesting? Outperform a benchmark? Higher success bars usually require more robust models and data.
8. **Market Regimes:** Ideally, your data should cover different market conditions (bull markets, bear markets, sideways chop, high/low volatility) so the model learns how patterns might change. This argues for longer time spans (multiple years).

## Practical Guidelines and Rules of Thumb (in the context of your script):

1. **Technical Minimums (Script)**:
MIN_RECORDS_FOR_INDICATORS: Enough data just to calculate the indicators without NaNs (e.g., 30-50 points depending on settings).
N_STEPS: The lookback window for the LSTM (60 points).
MIN_TRAIN_RECORDS_PER_STOCK: The absolute minimum per stock set in the script (e.g., MIN_RECORDS_FOR_INDICATORS + 100 = ~150 points). This is likely far too low for reliable predictions, it's just a threshold to allow the script to attempt training on that stock.
2. **Bare Minimum for Meaningful Patterns (Hourly/Daily Data):**
You likely need at least several months to a year of data per stock that you want the model to learn effectively from. For hourly data, this means thousands of data points per stock. This gives the model a chance to see some short-term cycles and non-trivial indicator behavior.
3. **Capturing Market Regimes (Recommended):**
Ideally, 2-5+ years of data is often recommended, especially if using daily frequency. For hourly data, even 1-2 years provides a very large dataset that can capture more diverse market conditions. This helps the model generalize better to unseen future conditions.
4 **Focus on Quality and Recent Data:**
While long history is good, sometimes very old data (e.g., 10+ years ago) might represent market structures that are no longer relevant. Ensure data quality is high (no major gaps, errors). Some strategies weigh recent data more heavily.

### Conclusion:

For your goal of predicting the next few hours/days using hourly-like data and the 6-feature LSTM:

- Start by aiming for at least 6 months to 1 year of clean, continuous historical data per stock you intend to trade frequently. This translates to roughly 800-1600+ data points per stock at hourly frequency.
- More is generally better, especially up to 2-3 years, to capture more market variety.
- Crucially, don't rely on data length alone. The only way to know if your data and model are sufficient is through rigorous backtesting on unseen historical data (a hold-out set) and potentially forward testing (simulated trading on live data). Analyze the backtesting results (win rate, profit factor, drawdown) to gauge effectiveness and determine if more data, better features, or model tuning are needed.
